description: ALWAYS use this skill directly when building, modifying, or debugging an OCP (Optimizely Connect Platform) app — adding functions, jobs, data sync sources or destinations, lifecycle hooks, OAuth flows, settings forms, Opal tools, ODP schema extensions, or anything that touches app.yml, the @zaiusinc/app-sdk, @zaiusinc/node-sdk, or @optimizely-opal/opal-tool-ocp-sdk. This skill is self-contained and handles all phases including design decisions.

# OCP App Development

OCP (Optimizely Connect Platform) is a serverless platform and marketplace for building apps that connect external systems with each other and with Optimizely products. Apps are published to the OCP App Directory as data sync apps, end-to-end apps, or Opal tools.

## App Types

### Data sync app

The app exposes one or more custom **sources**, **destinations**, or both in the OCP **Sync Manager** — the UI where customers pair sources and destinations. A source receives data from an external system and emits it into the **sync pipeline** — the runtime data flow between a paired source and destination; a destination receives data from the pipeline and delivers it to an external system. The app handles authorization and schema for each external system it integrates.

In addition to sources and destinations from OCP apps, the platform provides built-in options that customers can pair with:
- **Built-in sources:** CMP (Content Marketing Platform), OCP database, Optimizely Graph
- **Built-in destinations:** Optimizely Graph, Content Recommendations

**Use when:** you are integrating one or more external systems and want customers to control the pairings in the Sync Manager — connecting your sources or destinations with other OCP apps or Optimizely products.

### End-to-end app

The app defines the complete data flow between two specific, hardcoded systems. It handles authorization and schema for both sides and runs the sync automatically. Customers install, authorize both systems, and the app does the rest. These apps do not appear in the Sync Manager — the pairing is fixed.

**Use when:** both systems are predetermined by the developer — for example, pulling records from a CRM and syncing them to a marketing platform.

### Opal tool

The app exposes capabilities of an external service as AI tools in the Opal assistant. No data sync involved — the app receives tool calls from Opal and returns results.

**Use when:** you want Opal users to query or act on an external service through natural language — for example, running reports, searching records, or triggering actions.

**Decide the app type before writing any code** — it shapes the entire implementation. Ask: who decides which two systems are connected? Developer fixes both → end-to-end. Customer chooses at sync time → data sync. No sync, only AI tool calls → Opal tool.

| SDK | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `@zaiusinc/app-sdk` | Core framework — functions, jobs, lifecycle, destinations, storage, notifications |
| `@zaiusinc/node-sdk` | ODP data access — events, customers, objects, GraphQL |
| `@optimizely-opal/opal-tool-ocp-sdk` | Opal AI tools — `@tool` and `@interaction` decorators |

Every component runs in the context of one OCP account and one installation, identified by:

- **`trackerId`** *(string)* — uniquely identifies an **OCP account** (a customer workspace).
- **`installId`** *(number)* — uniquely identifies an **installation** of the app. Each account installs the app at most once, giving a 1:1 mapping between `trackerId` and `installId`.

## Developer Journey

The OCP CLI drives the entire lifecycle — from registering the app to invoking deployed functions. Not all steps apply to every app type — follow the steps relevant to what you are building. **Always read the relevant reference file from the table below before acting on any step** — reference files contain exact commands, component types, and options.

1. **Reserve an app ID** *(one-time)* — register the app ID before writing any code
2. **Scaffold the project** — create the project structure with the latest `app-sdk` and `node-sdk`
3. **Add components** — scaffold each component (functions, jobs, sources, destinations)
4. **Settings form** — write `forms/*.yml` for per-account configuration (credentials, toggles, OAuth buttons)
5. **Schema** — write custom ODP fields in `schema/` if the app needs to extend the ODP data model
6. **Lifecycle hooks** — implement install, settings, uninstall, and OAuth lifecycle hooks
7. **Business logic** — write function and job bodies
8. **Validate** — validate the app manifest and type-check the TypeScript
9. **Package and upload** — package and upload the app for publishing
10. **Publish** — make the version available in the OCP App Directory
11. **Install** — install the app into an account, creating unique webhook URLs per installation
12. **Retrieve webhook URLs** — retrieve the webhook URLs for an installation to invoke the functions

## Modifying an Existing App

When a request comes in against an existing app rather than a new one:

1. **Read `app.yml` first** — it is the source of truth for what components exist and what runtime is targeted
2. **Check installed SDK versions in `package.json`** before assuming an API exists
3. **Use the scaffolding commands for new components** even in an existing app — never hand-edit `app.yml` to add a function/job/source/destination
4. **Bump the version in `app.yml`** when shipping a change; use `-dev.N` suffix during development
